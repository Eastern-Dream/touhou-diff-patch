For Touhou 8 specifically, there are two disjoint version of the game that you could patch to the latest 1.00d version, but these two version cannot be patched to each other. These are `1.00a` and `1.00b`.

That is why ZUN patch for this starts out `1.00a` or `1.00b` and go straight to `1.00c` then `1.00d`. But you cannot patch from `1.00a` to `1.00b`.

I take special consideration that patch `1.00a` to `1.00b` exists by obtaining both versions independently.
